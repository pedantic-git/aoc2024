# Advent of Code 2024 - Quinn's solutions

Here's where I keep track of my solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

**Warning**: There may be spoilers inside!

## How to run

Most of the entries take advantage of Ruby's `ARGF` so they can be run by
supplying the appropriate file as a command-line arg or stdin.

They assume Ruby 3.3.x is your global Ruby interpreter.

For example:

```console
$ # As a parameter
$ ./01/01-1.rb ./01/example
11

$ # As stdin
$ ./01/01-2.rb < ./01/example
31
```

None of Quinn's input files are committed to the repo, as per the rules.
